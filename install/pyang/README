-* About *-
The set of these plug-ins can be used to generate
processed data model for netconfwebgui.
The output is a hierarchical directory structure
with files containing filters and model parts.

-* Prerequisites: *-
Installed pyang version 1.2 on the system.

-* Installation of pyang(1) plug-ins: *-
Copy plug-ins source codes into pyang(1) plugins directory:

# cp {nmp,resptempl,wyin}.py /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pyang/plugins

-* Usage *-
The simplifies method is to use nmp.sh script.
Script accepts all model formats that pyang(1) supports.

To get help, execute nmp.sh without arguments.

Example:
Read model ietf-netconf-monitoring from the current directory
and generate output directories hierarchy in
the /tmp/models directory:
$ ./nmp.sh -i ietf-netconf-monitoring.yang -o /tmp/models
